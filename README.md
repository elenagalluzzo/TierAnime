# TierAnime
TierAnime is an iOS app project I created that allows the user to search, save, and rate Animes and view their description, images, and genres. This data was generated using the [Anime DB Api by BrianRofiq](https://rapidapi.com/brian.rofiq/api/anime-db). The Anime information is displayed using table views. I used Cloud Firestore for data persistence to keep the userâ€™s saved Animes and their ratings.

TierAnime was built with Xcode and written in Swift 5X. The design was created using Storyboard and Auto Layout.
